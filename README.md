Written for [Flav Jam 1](https://itch.io/jam/flav-jam-1/), theme *PARALLEL UNIVERSES*.

## Abstract

Single-screen platformer.
Stage is populated with inert-ish objects of the same type.
From a certain place, you can switch universes -- cosmetic changes mostly, but also the inert objects change form:
- Pumpkin
- Balloon
- Bomb
- Hippopotamus

Bring an object into the Control Room with you, to prevent it from changing type.

## TODO

- [x] Music: 5 songs. Can I write 5 songs in 50 hours, and also write a game? I wrote 3 yesterday. Sure, why not!
- [x] bouncing_star, one of these instruments is out of tune or something
- [x] Dropping pumpkin: Mind initial position, ensure it's not inside a wall. Also, should be easier to drop off an edge.
- [ ] Graphics: Keep it simple because you're drawing 4 different universes of each thing.
- [x] Core mechanics: Walk, Jump, Carry
- [x] Subject actions: Float, Expode, Mosey
- [x] Level completion
- [x] Death
- [ ] Treadles
- [ ] Hello and farewell splashes.
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Design levels
- [ ] App icon
- [ ] Promo assets
- [ ] Itch page
